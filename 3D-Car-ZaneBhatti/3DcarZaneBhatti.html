  <h3>Project Background</h3>
  <p>
For our fourth project, we were tasked with replicating a toy car as close to scale as possible. To do this we used a program called OnShape, a 3D modeling software. In this software, we considered the X, Y, and Z planes of our car in a 3D form. The profile from each point of view defined the car's overall shape and structure. When considering what car I wanted to model, I at first thought about recreating cars from famous movies such as the Batmobile or the Ecto-1. I finally landed on the DeLorean DMC-12, not just because it was the base car for the time machine in Back To The Future, but also because I was one of my favorite cars of all time. I used a hot wheels car I had at home and set to work creating an engineering drawing that detailed the X, Y, and Z-axis’ of the car. Then I proceeded to complete my project with OnShape and Cura until I finally was able to print a 3D model of my car using the Ultimaker 3.

  <h3> Guildlines:</h3>
  <p> These are the guidelines to my project: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Car designed as an intersection of three forms </li>
  <li>Design car in a 1:1 ratio </li>
  <li>Size accuracy ±1%  </li>
  <li>Design is exported as stl </li>
  <li>Student orients model in Cura for 3D printing to minimize support material </li>
  <li>File is exported as a gcode </li>
  <li>Final design is shared out as an embedded STL on an HTML webpage </li>
</ul>

<h3> Project Steps:</h3>
<p> These are the steps I took to complete project: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Create an engineering drawing of the car. </li>
  <li>Explore OnShape tools. </li>
  <li>Create a 3D envlope, outlining the car. </li>
  <li>Use the extrude tool to remove negative space. </li>
  <li>Add additional detail to the car, such as fillets and wheels.  </li>
  <li>Export the model from OnShape. Then prepare and slice the file in Cura.  </li>
</ol>

<h3> Original Drawing:</h3>

  <img src = "drawing.jpeg" alt = "drawing" style = "width: 70%">
  <figcaption> This was the engineering drawing I sketched that I would use as a reference on my 3D envelope. </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3> 3D Envelope:</h3>

<figure>
  <img src = "envelope.jpeg" alt = "" style = "width: 70%">
  <figcaption> I extruded a rectangle from my selected plain that matched the same demensions as my model car. Then, I image-placed my drawing to their respective sides. </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3> Final Render:</h3>

<figure>
  <img src = "final.jpeg" alt = "" style = "width: 70%">
  <figcaption> I was left with a clunkly model after removing the negative space from my extrusion the first time. I spent a lot of time making additional details to make the car come to life. The result came out looking very accurate to my original model. </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3> CAD Drawing:</h3>

<figure>
  <img src = "cad.jpeg" alt = "" style = "width: 70%">
  <figcaption> In OnShape, I was able to make a professional CAD drawing that highlighted the details of my design, and provided accurate measurements of different areas. </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3> Replicated 3D Model:</h3>

<figcaption><i> Using an application called Modelo, I am able to embed my model in my website. </i></figcaption>

<h3> Final Product:</h3>
<figure>
  <img src = "end.jpeg" alt = "" style = "width: 50%">
  <figcaption> After slicing the file in Cura, I was able to finally print my model with supports and a base. In the end I think the print came out ver well, and looks even better placed next to the original model! </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Project Reflection</h3>
<p>
Now looking back on my project, I think there were steps I could have taken to have created an even more accurate model. During the negative space removal, I ran into problems with the title angle of the windows on the side of the car. Even though I had a perfect drawing on my X-axis (front) the space that was removed was not accurate to the original car because it cut slightly into the hood. The hood on the original car is flat I was not content with my model looking how it did. To fix this problem I created a new face and made individuals cuts along the side of the car, without it creasing into the hood. Because of this, I was left with a perfectly flat hood with as-close-to-accurate-as-possible window creases. The only area the became hard to manage were the window creases that were near the trunk area, which extended from the middle to the back end of the car. To fix this, I could have maybe added more faces/removals but I liked the car appeared in its current state. Overall I would say this project was very fun and I learned a lot about online 3D modeling and scaling. </p>
